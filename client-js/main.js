//  This is where all the client side js stuff is required so it can be bundled 
//  via Browserify. 
//  All the heavy old-school javascript libraries are exposed as browserify globals
//  because its easy and they don't play well with browserify without some work.
//
//  So far, as a general pattern I've been puting jQuery javascript
//  in smaller files. Then I just require them  here and execute the function to 
//  bind any events and whatever else to the page.
